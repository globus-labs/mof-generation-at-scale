# Make ligand templates from existing molecules

The notebook in this directory creates `LigandTemplate` from an existing molecule
by identifying the anchor groups at each end of a molecule and deleting 
all but a small set of atoms near those anchor groups.

Example molecules must be in the `mol` format.
